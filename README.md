   Contains the identified concepts that overlapped with the CQs and the available data. Each key notion has a brief description of the rationale, potential existing patterns for reuse, and applicable datasets.
3. **Patterns** \
   This directory includes the schema diagrams for each constructed pattern along with the final schema.
4. **Meeting-Minutes** \
   This directory contains the weekly meeting logs, which outline the discussion points and action items.
5. **Knowledge-Engineering-Presentation-Final** \
   The midterm presentation.
6. **Robotic-Orchestration-Presentation.pdf** \
   The final presentation used in the video presentation.
7. **Documentation.md** \
   The final document summarizing the entire class project.
8. **Protege** \
   Contains OWL file with the axioms applied using Protege the software.

The deliverables are structured as follows.

1. Use-Case \
   Contains the narrative of our use case and motivation for the research, along with the initially formulated competency questions (CQs) and available datasets.
2. Key-Notions \
   Contains the identified concepts that overlapped with the CQs and the available data. Each key notion has a brief description of the rationale, potential existing patterns for reuse, and applicable datasets.
3. Patterns \
   This directory includes the schema diagrams for each constructed pattern.

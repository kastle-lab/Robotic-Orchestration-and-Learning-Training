The deliverables are structured as follows.

1. **Use-Case** \
   Contains the narrative of our use case and motivation for the research, along with the initially formulated competency questions (CQs) and available datasets.
2. **Key-Notions** \
   Contains the identified concepts that overlapped with the CQs and the available data. Each key notion has a brief description of the rationale, potential existing patterns for reuse, and applicable datasets.
3. **Patterns** \
   This directory includes the schema diagrams for each constructed pattern.
4. **Meeting-Minutes** \
   This directory contains the weekly meeting logs, which outline the discussion points and action items.
5. **Paper-Reviews** \
   This directory contains the paper reviews of each group member from the first half of the semester.
6. **Knowledge-Engineering-Presentation-Final** \
   The midterm presentation.

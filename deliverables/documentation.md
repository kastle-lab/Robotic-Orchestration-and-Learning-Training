# Modular Ontology for Autonomous Robotic Orchestration

**Authors:** Michael McCain, Chris Davis Jaldi, Shreyas Casturi, and Susan Shrestha

## Use Case Scenario

### Narrative

Domains that rely heavily on robotics have shown an increasing interest in autonomous systems that are collaborative, intelligent, and capable of reasoning [1, 2, 3]. In pursuit of these interests, a standard method for increasing autonomy among robots [2] and enabling collaboration is the use of knowledge representation in the form of ontologies [4] and knowledge graphs (KG) [2, 3, 5]. Due to the relatively recent focus on achieving these ambitious and complex autonomous systems, there are many competing approaches, especially in the context of task planning [1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8]. However, these approaches vary in terms of ontology design or methodology, but do use the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) Web Ontology Language (OWL) [9] as the primary logic-based language for semantic representation. Unfortunately, as highlighted in [2], many of these ontologies lack reusability and do not meet the need for the confluence of existing ontologies.

Considering these aspects for the current ontological representations of complex autonomous systems, we want to engineer an ontology that could enable these multi-agent systems (MAS) [3] to be governed and commanded by an AI Orchestrator capable of the following: understanding its environment, decomposing goals into atomic subtasks, agent assignment based on capabilities, and status verification. More importantly, it would be designed to be general enough to support reusability and allow for adaptation to the domain of need. This ontology would be designed using state-of-the-art (SOTA) best practices to ensure modularity and reusability [10, 11] through the use of ontological design patterns (ODPs) [12]. This would fill two needs. The first would be to provide an ontology that allows for more complex autonomous MAS. The second is the demand for a reusable ontology that facilitates the merging of existing ontologies across domains that utilize these MAS.

### Competency Questions

- What set of agents are required to complete primary goal y?
- What are the classifications/categories that of a set of objects?
- What objects are required for goal g?
- What objects are required to complete task x?
- What are the dependent tasks for task z?
- Which tasks share common dependent tasks across different goals?

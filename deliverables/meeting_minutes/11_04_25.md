# Meeting Minutes

**Date: 10/28/2025**

## Agenda
- Review which key notions need to still be defined.
- Make a plan to define them/work on defining these remaining notions.

## Notes
- Capability/archetype done
- Discussions about task vs execution vs assignment patterns (archetype vs goal-task pattern)
- Future patterns for Role + Agent: 
  - Participant-Role Pattern
    - If you want to capture more data about agent, such as "how long the agent was in a given role", this would be helpful.
  - Agent-Role Pattern
  - Role-dependent name pattern
- Discussed time requirements/constraints for Task and/or Subgoals and how to potentially represent

## Action Items
- Define Role Key Notion/Pattern (Michael)
- In Goal-Task pattern, add Role as external entity (Chris)
- Make an Object pattern, define subclasses, such as Agent (Shreyas)
- Model Event schema (Susan)
  - Model all state changes that occur throughout execution process of a task
  - SpatialThings have State, so Event will encompass the States of:
    - Object
    - Environment
    - Agent

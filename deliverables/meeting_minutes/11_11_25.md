# Meeting Minutes

**Date: 11/11/2025**

## Agenda

- Review current patterns and pending pull request to fill for key notion and relation gaps.

## Notes

- Discussion on `Goal` pattern ( focus on Capturing a Success notion with a `State` vs an `Event`)
- Discussions about finding missing connections to `Event` (which is more relevant connection - `SpatiaThing` or `Role Participation` or both and if so, why)
- Discussion around `Spatial Thing` pattern (overriden use of `partOf` ans `isPartOf`):
  - No conclusion reached, find an alternative for review or deal with overriden use of it in documentation
- Dicussion on Object pattern
  - mostly around the explicit requirement of `Category` vs `Object` Subclasses and if both, why
  - Where is Control Vocabulary more apt where are Subclasses more apt
    - Current conclusion - Control Vocab for `Category` and Subclasses for `Object` - To be review by team in next meeting
- Discussion and Clarification of `Role` pattern
  - Winstons `Relation Instance` adaption and how it affects our current relations
- Discussion on immediate current Next steps for 3 weeks to wrap up project
  - Data handling routes (Synthetic (derived from dataset meta data) vs real dataseta)
  - Axiomatization (what all should be axiomatized)

## Action Items

- Add an alternative Success Event mapping for review with professor (Chris)
- In Goal-Task pattern, Tag `Task` to `Role` and `Role Participation` external entities (Chris)

- Make changes to `Object` pattern based on new `Spatial Thing` pattern (Shreyas)
  - Research and add additional subclass to Object to make its distiction from `Category`
- Model `Category` pattern changes - Control Vocab (Shreyas)
- Define new key notion for `Role Participation` and specify distinction (Michael)
- Define new key notion for `Role Category` and specify distinction on why it needs to be differnt from `Category` (Michael)

# Meeting Minutes

**Date: 10/28/2025**

## Agenda

1. Narrow constraints/finalize definitions, such as, for example, clarifying "State" verbiage. "State" was being used interchangeably for different key notions.
2. Finalize Key Notions/make any additional updates
3. Select potential ODPs/build ODPs for finalized Key notions.

## Notes

1. Finalized subclass notion for the State -- there will be an Environment State, Object State, Robot State., these are all subclasses of a higher State.

2. Debated how to define Environment (about an hour and a half of time)... with no final determination.

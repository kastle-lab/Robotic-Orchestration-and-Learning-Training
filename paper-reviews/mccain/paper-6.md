## Report

### Summary

This section of the Hogan paper goes over ways in which deduction and "reasoning" can be achieved in computers through the use of ontologies, semantics, entailment, and descriptive logic.

### Key Takeaways

1. `Entailment regimes` is the term used to describe the application of rules, constraints, and semantics to a knowledge graph to allow for inferencing.
2. According to the authors `Rules`, if-then conditionals, are considered the easiest way to deduce knowledge using inferencing.
3. `Rules` can be used for `query rewriting` which is the automation of restructuring the query to follow the rules imposed on the graph.

### Questions to Instructor

1. What is meant by "Expressive description logics" in the last paragraph on page 32?

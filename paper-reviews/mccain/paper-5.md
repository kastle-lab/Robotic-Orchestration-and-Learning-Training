### Summary

{summary-text}

### Key Takeaways

1. When representing data of many varieties on larger scales the default choice in semantic representation is OWA.
2. `Shapes` are used to define a `validation graph`. These `shapes` are a set of nodes that have been selected for specific constraints.
3. `Lexicalisation` through the use of identifiers with labels is a great way to
   ground a nodes identity and allow for cross referencing in other texts.

### Questions to Instructor

1. To me, the paper did not clearly explain `emergent schema`, more so the defining `quotient graph`, would you be able to give a more clear example in class?
2. How and/or when are annotations added to a graph?

## Report

### Summary

This section goes over the various types of data graphs, some example use cases, and the graph patterns that are the basis of graph query languages.

### Key Takeaways

1. A primary benefit of using data graphs is that they do not require the hierarchical structuring of data.
2. You can use `blank nodes` for things that do not have an identifier.
3. Knowledge graphs can adopt any variety of these data graphs.

### Questions to Instructor

1. If KGs can adopt any of these data graphs, are there any measurable requirements that might dictate using one graph model over another?

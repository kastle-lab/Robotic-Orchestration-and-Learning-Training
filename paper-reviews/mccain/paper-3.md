## Report

### Summary

In this section of the Hogan paper the authors provide a brief easy to understand introduction into what a knowledge graph is and how it gained popularity. Then they outline the intent of the paper, which is to provide a comprehensive understanding toward knowledge graphs and current best practices. Following this they provide further clarification on what a knowledge graph is, how they can be used, and give an example application.

### Key Takeaways

1. The importance of Knowledge Graphs is to provide a malleable and abstract way of representing relationships between data.
2. `Nodes` = Entities,

   `Edges` = Relationships,

   `Schema` = High level structure of a KG

   `Identity` = Associated nodes with an IRL entity

   `Context` = Setting of truth

3. Knowledge graphs require maintenance in the sense that extraction, enrichment, quality
   assessment, and refinement are necessary for a KG to evolve.

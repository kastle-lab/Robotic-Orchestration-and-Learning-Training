## Report

### Summary

The paper goes over the motivation behind the implementation of the semantic web, the evolution of knowledge, and the potential consequences of a structured web.

### Key Takeaways

1. The semantic web is an extension of the WWW and is used to enable the automatic processing of data with computers while simultaneously enabling computers to "understand" the data.
2. The challenges for the semantic web are to provide a language that expresses both data and rules for reasoning about said data. Also, to allow rules from any existing knowledge representation system to be exported onto he web.
3. URIs are essentially references to definitions of things.
4. Inference rules allow for easier manipulation of data for human consumption.

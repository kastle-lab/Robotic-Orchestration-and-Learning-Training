## Report

### Summary

This section discusses the various ways in which inductive knowledge can be applied to KGs using graph analytics techniques.

### Key Takeaways

1. Using analytics with entailment is a relatively unexplored field.
2. Translational models (TransE) are a simple way to predict edges and identify the most plausible nodes using vectors. However, TransE can be too simplistic.
3. When using the symbolic learning method of `Rule Mining`, the search space can become exponentially large, resulting in inefficiencies. `Pruning` is a way to mitigate this inefficiency, but this scalability issue needs to be considered.
4. When `Axiom Mining` disjoint axioms are a common choice according to the research.

### Questions to Instructor

1. Why are disjoint axioms such a popular choice for Axiom Mining?
2. What are the important aspects to be considered when choosing to apply any of the analytic techniques to a KG?

## Report

### Summary

This paper goes over the history of the Semantic Web to include ontologies, linked data, and knowledge graphs, from the perspective of the author. Pascal clearly states that this review is subjective and selective as the paper is nowhere near comprehensive.

### Key Takeaways

1. Motivation behind The Semantic Web(SW) was to create a system for machine understandable information disseminated by agents.
2. One perspective is that the SW is now primarily used as a way to share, find, integrate, and reuse data efficiently.
3. While the US lost interest early in the development of Semantic technologies, the EU maintained an interest and continues to explore the field.
4. **Linked Data** A collection of RDF graphs linked through IRIs.
5. Knowledge graphs are essentially a rebranding of Linked Data, but with a focus on being publicly accessible.

### Questions to Instructor

1. Pascal mentions that an effort is needed to consolidate the field. So, what does this consolidation look like in your mind?
2. On the same topic of consolidation of the field, the author notes that academia is largely disincentivized to pursue this goal; why? Also, if there could be an attempt toward consolidation in academia, what form would this come in?

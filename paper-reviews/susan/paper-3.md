### Summary

In summary, Knowledge Graphs have revolutionized how we organize, connect, and utilize information since Google's 2012 announcement.

From open public resources to proprietary enterprise solutions, KGs have become fundamental tools for managing knowledge at scale.

### Key Takeaways

2. Both public companies and private enterprises have embraced KGs to organize their data assets.
3. KGs serve different purposes - from powering search engines to enabling recommendation systems and supporting business intelligence.
4. Building effective KGs requires thoughtful approaches to data models, identity management, and context preservation.

## Report

### Summary

In summary, knowledge graphs provide a powerful way to organize and connect information with additional layers of meaning through schema, identity, and context. Schema defines the structure and meaning of data, identity ensures entities are uniquely identified across different sources, and context adds situational relevance to the data. These elements work together to make knowledge graphs more useful for both humans and machines.
### Key Takeaways

1. Schema acts like a blueprint for your data, helping organize information and enabling systems to make logical connections between related concepts.
2. A popular way to define the validation rules is using shape graph. We define shapes for nodes (like UML diagrams) that specify constraints on entity and their relationship.
3. In Semantic Web, RDF 1.1 recommends using IRIs (Internationalized Resource Identifiers) as they identify entities and relationships in a graph. 
4. When connecting information from multiple sources, identity links (like owl:sameAs) act as bridges that tells two entities refer to same thing.

### Questions to Instructor

1. Let's discuss on emergent schema as I am not that clear by reading the paper.
2. Are the context subjective?

## Report

### Summary

In summary, the Semantic Web has evolved from a focus on formal ontologies and linked data to more practical knowledge graphs. This journey represents the field's shift from academic theory to real-world applications that power many of today's AI and search technologies.

### Key Takeaways

1. Semantic Web technologies help computers understand meaning in data, not just process it.
2. Ontologies provide the structured framework that defines concepts and their relationships.
3. The technology stack (RDF, OWL, SPARQL) works together to create, structure, and query semantic data.
4. Knowledge Graphs represent the practical, industry-focused evolution of semantic web concepts.
5. The field has gradually shifted from purely academic research to powering real-world applications like search engines and recommendation systems.

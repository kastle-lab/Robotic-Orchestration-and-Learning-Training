### Summary

Data graphs are powerful structures for representing complex relationships. From the basic directed edge-labeled graphs to more sophisticated property graphs, each model offers unique ways to connect and organize information. Query languages like SPARQL and Cypher provide mechanisms to extract meaningful insights from these graphs through pattern matching, relational operations, and path expressions. Understanding these concepts is essential for working with modern graph databases and knowledge representation systems.

### Key Takeaways

1. Graph models store connections between data points, making them ideal for representing relationships.
2. Different graph models (directed edge-labeled, property graphs, etc.) serve different use cases and complexity levels.
3. Graph patterns act like templates to match and extract specific subgraphs from your data.
4. Query results can be manipulated using relational operations like projection, selection, and joins.
5. Path expressions enable navigation through multiple connections, finding relationships that span several hops.
6. Graph databases like Neo4j implement these concepts for real-world applications.
7. Graph querying combines graph patterns with relational algebra.

### Questions to Instructor
1. Discuss more on Heterogeneous Graph. Is heterogeneous graph such type of graph that has types for both nodes and their relations?
1. Explain more on Homomorphism-based semantics and Isomorphism-based semantics.

### Summary

The introduction of this paper discusses the key ideas of knowledge graphs, and cites relevant sources that show that knowledge graph development and usage is an increasingly important and popular topic.

This section shows that the paper will "give a comprehensive intro to knwoledge graphs... describ`[ing]` their foundational data models... discuss`[ing]` representations

### Key Takeaways

1. Using knowledge graphs allows you to potentially better extract value from unstructured data (this is dependent, of course, on the underlying ontology).
2. There are two methods by which we can obtain knowledge: deductive methods (using axioms and information to beget more information) and inductive methods (using a series of example axioms to prove a generalizable rule)
3. Graphs are useful because they can allow us to formalize complex interrelationships in a variety of different domains, while capturing only essential details.

### Questions to Instructor

1. How exactly do graphs "allow maintainers to postpone the definition of a schema..."? I thought all the knowledge graphs we've talked about still had underlying schemas for their ontologies? The schema has to be defined prior, even if it can be made flexibly so, right? Or is that merely saying that you can accept the graph schema itself (nodes + edges), and not have to deal with a formal schema for the data you are trying to represent?

## Report

### Summary

This part of the paper deals with the ways in which knowledge graphs are constructed from a variety of different data formats.

### Key Takeaways

1. Ontology engineering is the step that one takes AFTER the data has been processed/ingested.
2. The creation of the ontology can happen automatically (ontology learning) or have human-basd methods (such as humans constructing the ontology by hand).

### Questions to Instructor
1. I'm curious about how transformers and ANNs do when learning the ontology from the text, as seen in one of the papers I had to review for KCAP. What bottlenecks currently exist?

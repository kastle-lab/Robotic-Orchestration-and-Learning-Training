## Report

### Summary

This paper discusses the notion of deduction using knowledge graphs, going over concepts such as entailment regimes, premises. In order to facilitate this, the paper discusses ontologies before discussing how the ontologies and semantics can lead to entailments (the ability to deduce from initial premises), and what the implications are on reasoning.

### Key Takeaways

1. When discussing whether one graph is entailed by another, this is an undecidable problem, but there are approximate solutions.
2. We can add inference rules ot aid the creation of deductive knowledge.
3. Ultimately, the issue of deducing knowledge via entailment can be reduced down to satisfiability.

### Questions to Instructor

1. I want to confirm that the ability to reason, at least deductively, is a tripartite issue of using knowledge graphs, using ontologies, and making sure the semantics of the ontology allow for accurate and efficient inference/deduction?

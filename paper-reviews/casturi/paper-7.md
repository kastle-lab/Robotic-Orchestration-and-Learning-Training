## Report

### Summary
This paper discusses a methodology to perform Modular Ontology development, called MOMo (Modular Ontology Modeling methodology). MOMo emphasizes the use and creation of graphical schema diagrams. The paper describes the workflow of MOMo, and resources for using it/executing it. The paper also discusses the tooling infrastructure of the methodology, called CoModIDE, and discusses how the efficacy of CoModIDE was established, through an experimental study.

The paper is concerned with how ontology reuse fails, because of differences in representational granularity, conceptual clarity lacking, lack of adherence to modeling principles and patterns, and that tooling for ontology creation doesn't often support ontology reuse.

The paper goes over various ontology engineering methods, such as OTKM, METHONTOLOGY, DILIGENT, among others. The key issue is that these methods only offer broad guidance on how to construct an ontology, but lower-level/fine-grained guidance is lacking. Ontology Design Patterns (ODPs) were introduced as a result, as they would give explicit guidance/templating for how to capture certain modeling problems/phenomena. Yet the tools that support these ODPs don't support design pattern re-use.

MOMo focuses on the creation of modules and facilitates easy interlinking between modules, and offers ODPs that are readily applicable to the future problems at hand, and emphasizes modeling using diagrams. The rest of the paper focuses on the details of the MOMo methodology.

### Key Takeaways

1. Prior Modular Ontology engineering suffered from a tooling problem, not necessarily a structural problem as it related to the methdologies (eXtreme, etc...)
2. Using diagrams and whiteboarding can help in the design of an ontology, and tools to that effect can enable ontology re-use.

### Questions to Instructor

1. So is the issue overall one of tooling, or one of design? Or is it both? I guess my question is, there's a difference between investigating the fundamental KG theory vs. the systems that allow us to make them (just as there is a difference between system design and actually building systems)?

### Summary

This section of the paper draws a distinction between the data graph and the knowledge graph. The data graph is the nodes and edges, but the knowledge graph is the data graph with additions of schema, identity, and context. 

There are different types of schema, such as semantic, whree you can define Subclasses, domain, range, etc... on the graph (RDF allows for this), validating schema, which allows us to view a graph using shapes (like a UML diagram), and emergent schema, which may involve quotient graphs (which allow nodes to be partitioned into different classes).

For identity, we have to solve the issue of what knowledge a node is referring to, i.e, the issue of "disambiguation", by using globally-unique identifiers and even external identity links. 

Lastly, we deal with the issue of context, such as a temporal context ( a time period), geographic context (a place), etc... in the sense that facts are often true with respect to certain/given contexts. We can add these contexts to the nodes and/or edges depending on the use case.


### Key Takeaways

1. There is a distinction between the data graph and knowledge graph, through the use of schemas, identity, and contexts.

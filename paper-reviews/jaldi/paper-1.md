2. Core technology usage started with xml (structured) and progressed to RDF etc (more ontology supported formats) to encode semantics and inference rules and allow sharing and integrating of data effectively
3. Semantic Web proposes a global, evolving network of linked data and reasoning agents whichwill be supporting everything from complex service chains to smart devices

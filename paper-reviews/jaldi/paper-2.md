## Report

### Summary

Paper goes over a selective and subjective overview of the Semantic Web as a research field which is a bit comprehensive from previous Tim's paper but through Pascal's lens and mainly traces the evolution of the field across three major phases.

### Key Takeaways

1. Despite successes like schema.org and Wikidata, the field suffers from fragmented tools and approaches (standardization and integration issues)
2. Seamntic web community evolved in phases namely Ontologies, Linked Data Representaions, Knowledge Graphs.

### Questions to Instructor

1. Its weird how ontology design and modeling foundation work was phrased as initial days, followed by linked data age and then knowledge graphs. Arent they just bad KGs somewhere in between and we are just trying to formalie more standards on how to make them good?
2. Pascal notes the sudden shift toward proprietary knowledge graphs, so how can the Semantic Web community preserve openness and interoperability while meeting industry demands which varies alot?

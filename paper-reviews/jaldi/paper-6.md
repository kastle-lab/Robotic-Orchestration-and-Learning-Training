## Report

### Summary

This section explores how systems can derive implicit information from explicit facts within a knowledge graph with explicit formalization through premises, ontologies, and entailment regimes, where reasoning strategies from rule-based systems to description logics can illustrate how KGs can support deductive inference.

### Key Takeaways

1. Explicit formalized entailment rules often required for machines to navigate through human like reasoning
2. Axiomatic representations form different box according to their nature: asserting claims (A-Box), defining class axioms (T-box), property axioms (R-Box)

### Questions to Instructor

1. How can we balance between more expressive ontologies (which allow richer reasoning) and computational tractability in real-world?
2. How does SPARQL Inferencing Notation (SPIN) and Description Logic work in real-world for deductive reasoning or can they?

## Report

### Summary

This sections explores how knowledge can be inferred from patterns in data rather than like Deductive Knwoeldge one by generalizing from observations to produce predictions which may be uncertain but have a possibility to hold. It introduces 4 interesting categories:

- Graph Analytics (Unsupervised)
- KGE
- GNN
- Other symbolic learning/mining

### Key Takeaways

1. Inductive knowledge depends on pattern generalization and enables predictions with an associated confidence scores rather than confiremd guarantee
2. Some numeric and symbolic approaches (KGE, GNNs, rule mining) allow for different trade-offs between interpretability and scalability
3. Inductive methods are vital for making KGs more practical and predictive and extend their application beyond static deductive reasoning

### Questions to Instructor

1. While KGE preserve some semantics wrt to the method used, how does the same translate with GNNs? Arent all or most semantics aspects ingored?
2. It reads as if symbolic approaches allow interpretability and KGE and GNNs provide better scalability, how do we choose one pover the other and how does that effect the KG tasks performed?

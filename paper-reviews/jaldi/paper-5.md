## Report

### Summary

This section explores the key concepts of KGs i.e. schema (semantic definitions), identity (disambiguation and uniqueness), context (awareness and representation accordingly) and synergy between them provide structrual layers to KGs

### Key Takeaways

1. Semantics, validation, and emergent schemata together support reasoning, constraint validation, and automatic structure discovery within knowledge graphs
2. Global identifiers, external identity links, and datatype/lexicalisation practices are critical for merging and aligning diverse data sources and avoiding ambiguity
3. Contextual information scoping like provenance, temporal scope complements schema and identity to ensure that knowledge remains meaningful and accurate across different context specific situations

### Questions to Instructor

1. The diferrence between reification and Higher-arity representation is confusingly articulated. How are they differnt or the same?
2. Personally, I have a problem understanding the differences between open and closed world assumptions. What are those?

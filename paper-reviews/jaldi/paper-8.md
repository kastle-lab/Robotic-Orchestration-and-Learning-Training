## Report

### Summary

This section explore various KG creation processes which mainly focuses on knowledge extraction process in unstructured and knowledge conservation in structured, and how we can mine from differnt sources. it sheds some light on ontology engineering and adaption while introducing ODPs

### Key Takeaways

1. Named Entity Recognition (NER), Entity Linking (EL), Relation Extraction (RE) from NLP techjniques are critical to create and enrich KGs.
2. Automation is not close yet; Humans bring precision and domain expertise but introduce cost and bias and automated extraction scales better but requires careful validation

### Questions to Instructor

1. Among the enrichment methods (human collaboration, text/markup extraction, structured sources, or leveraging external knowledge graphs), which do you see as most impactful in large-scale deployments?

### Key Takeaways

1. KG definition as "graph of data" with its parts like nodes as entities, and edges as relations b/w entities.
2. KGs serve as flexible, evolving repositories for many practical tasks such as search, recommendation systems, and analytics, with both open (Wikidata, DBpedia) and enterprise (Google, Facebook) use cases

### Questions to Instructor

1. How is this “inclusive” definition ok for KG and not as DG? How might this broad definition affect interoperability or standardization across different implementations?
